# Coffee Sales - Project Overview
## Description:
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data using Excel to create an interactive and dynamic dashboard. The dashboard enables users to filter and visualize sales metrics across various dimensions such as roast type, size, loyalty card status, and customer information. The key goals were to uncover insights into total sales trends, sales by country, and customer-specific sales performance. The project involved several stages including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features:
- **Dynamic Slicers:** The dashboard incorporates slicers to filter data based on:
       a. Order Date (with granular monthly and yearly options).
       b. Roast Type Name (Dark, Light, Medium).
       c. Size of coffee purchased (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, and 2.5 kg).
       d. Loyalty Card Status (Yes, No).
  
- **Sales Over Time (Line Graph):**
  - This graph showcases the trend of coffee sales (in USD) from 2019 to 2022, segmented by different coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, Robusta).
  - Helps to track monthly fluctuations in sales, and identify peak and off-peak sales periods.
  
- **Sales by Country (Bar Chart):**
  - Displays sales performance segmented by country (United States, Ireland, United Kingdom).
   - Offers insights into which country contributes most to the overall revenue, with the United States leading at $35,639, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom.
  
-**Top 5 Customers (Horizontal Bar Chart):**
   - Identifies the top customers based on sales.
   - Provides the exact revenue contribution for each customer, with Allis Wilmore being the highest contributor at $317.
     
## Project Breakdown:
### Data Cleaning:
**The raw coffee sales data was processed to:**
   -Handle missing data.
   -Standardize entries, ensuring uniformity in roast type, coffee size, and customer names.
   -Convert date and currency formats to allow for easier analysis.

### Data Analysis:
-Using pivot tables and Excel formulas, key metrics such as total sales, sales by country, and customer-specific sales were calculated.
-Monthly and yearly sales were computed to allow for the time series analysis shown in the "Total Sales Over Time" graph.

### Data Visualization:
Created multiple charts and graphs, each providing a different perspective on coffee sales data:
    -Line chart to track sales over time segmented by coffee type.
    -Bar charts for country-specific and customer-specific sales insights.
    
Integrated slicers for interactive filtering of the data, allowing for dynamic adjustment of the visualizations based on user selections.

## Insights Derived:
**Seasonal Trends:**
-Sales have noticeable peaks during certain months, with some coffee types (like Arabica) performing better in specific periods.

**Geographical Sales Performance:**
-The United States dominates sales, making up a large proportion of the overall revenue.
-Potential growth opportunities in other regions like the United Kingdom can be identified.

**Customer Insights:**
-Top customers are responsible for a significant portion of the sales, with opportunities to leverage loyalty programs or targeted marketing to further boost sales.

## Technologies Used:
**Microsoft Excel:** Primary tool for data analysis and visualization.
     - **Pivot Tables** for summarizing and analyzing data.
     - **Slicers** and Filters for dynamic data filtering.
     - **Charts** (Line, Bar, etc.) for data visualization.

## Future Work:
- Incorporating additional filters (e.g., payment method, promotional offers) for more granular insights.
- Integrating the dashboard with external data sources like customer feedback for a more comprehensive analysis.

## How to Use:
1. Open the Excel file containing the dashboard.
2. Use the slicers to filter data by Date, Roast Type, Size, and Loyalty Card Status.
3. Analyze the visualizations to explore trends in coffee sales over time, sales by country, and customer-specific sales.


## Conclusion:
This coffee sales dashboard is a powerful tool that enables businesses to gain insights into their sales performance over time, across different geographies, and for specific customer segments. The interactive features make it easy to explore data in a user-friendly manner, facilitating better decision-making for marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer relationship initiatives.
